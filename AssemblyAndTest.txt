Assembly and Test Instructions (PCB Rev1.2)
============================================================
The board should be assembled and tested in sections to ensure proper functioning. Assembly goes through the following sections in order:

1. Car Power Isolation
2. Nucleo and Accessories (including sensor RC filters)
3. Sensors
4. FET Driver
5. CAN
6. DC/DC Converter (power electronics)

------------------------------------------------------------
0. Initial Checks
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Before installing anything, check for power shorts where there shouldn't be:
* Between Array + and -
* Between Battery + and -
* Between Array and Battery
* Between Car Power +12 and GND
* Between Car Power +5 and GND
* Between Car Power +12 and +5
* Between Iso 9V + and -
* Between Car Power and Iso 9V
* Between Array/Battery and Iso 9V
* Between CAN Iso Vout + and -
* Between CAN Iso Vin + and -
* Between CAN Iso Vout and Vin
* Between Iso 9V and CAN Iso

Other important shorts to check for and eliminate:
* Between CAN H and L
* Between MOSFET terminals
* Between Schottky Diode terminals
* Between heat sinks and ground
* On each Nucleo board, between A4 and D4 (shorted by SB18)
* On each Nucleo board, between A5 and D5 (shorted by SB16)

1. Car Power Isolation
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
NOTE: Due to errors in the board and lack of availability when ordering parts, the following part changes need to be made:
* We are using a 12V-12V regulator rather than 12V-9V
  because the 12V-9V regulator wasn't available at ordering
  time. The Nucleo, FET Driver, and Current Sensors can
  handle these voltages fine.
* Because the output voltage is now 12V, use a 4.7k resistor
  for R20.
* I mis-sized the footprints for C4, C5, and C24; they're
  too small for capacitors of the designated capacitances.
  We have two options here:
  * Install smaller, 0805 capacitors on the footprints
      (C4: 4.7uF Taiyo Yuden EMK212AB7475KGHT)
      (C5,C24: 10uF TDK C2012JB1C106K085AC)
  * Jerry-rig radial capacitors of the appropriate
    capacitance onto the pads.

----
Install the smallest components first: R14, R20, LED3, LED7, L4, C23, and then C4, C5, and C24. These can be done in any order, but if you're using radial capacitors for C4, C5, and C24 (i.e. radials or 1206/1210 SMDs), make sure to do those after the other smallest components. Next install test points 5, 6, 17, and 18, and then the power regulator U1. Finally, install the connector header.

After installation, double check for the following shorts:
* Between Car Power +12 and GND
* Between Car Power +5 and GND
* Between Car Power +12 and +5
* Between Iso 9V + and -
* Between Car Power and Iso 9V

Connect 12V to the connector at the appropriate pins and verify that 12V is produced at the Iso 9V + and - pins. (NOTE: Due to lack of availability, we're using a 12V-12V regulator rather than 12V-9V)

For an advanced test, produce a noisy 12V input and check the stability and cleanliness of the output.

2. Nucleo and Accessories (including sensor RC filters)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Install the smallest components first: R15-19, R23-24, C19-22, and LED4-6. Then install the headers for the Nucleo; try to make sure they are as perfectly perpendicular to the board as possible. Finally, install the Reset button, the CAN Address switches, and test points 7-10 and 26.

After installation, double check for a shorts between Iso 9V + and -.

Double check the functionality of the Reset button and the CAN Address switches by checking for shorts with the button pushed/not pushed and the switches in the on/off positions.

Plug in the Nucleo and then test for shorts between D4 (CAN Address pin 2) and A4 (Battery Voltage TP) and between D5 (CAN Address pin 3) and A5 (Array Voltage TP). If there are shorts here, you will need to remove SB18 or SB16, respectively, from the Nucleo board. **YOU MUST DO THIS FOR EVERY NUCLEO YOU PLUG INTO THE MPPT.**

Download a test program onto the Nucleo that turns on the Battery Full and Tracking LEDs and that outputs a PWM signal with a non-trival duty cycle (i.e. something like 66%, but not 0%, 50%, or 100%). Unplug the serial cable from the Nucleo, then connect 12V to the Car Power connector and make sure that the Nucleo starts up again. Make sure that the LEDs turn on and that the PWM signal looks accurate.

For an advanced test, apply analog signals to the sensor test points and check that the Nucleo software is measuring them properly. The sensors aren't installed yet, so there shouldn't be any danger with this. (TODO: Apply the signals to the input of the RC filters rather than the test points to avoid stressing the caps? Harder, but not infeasible. Would also allow testing the filters.)

3.1 Current Sensors
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The current sensors are smaller and more delicate than the voltage sensors, so they should be installed and tested first.

Begin by installing the sensor chips U4 and U6. Then check for the following shorts:
* Between Iso 9V + and -
* Between Array - and GND
* Between Battery - and GND
* Between the output of the battery sensor and GND
* Between the output of the array sensor and Array -

You can also check the last two by using the Battery and Array Current test points, but in that case a short would be indicated by a resistance of 1.7k rather than 0 because you would be going through R19 and R18, respectively.


Next install the shunt resistors R8 and R11 and the bypass capacitors C17 and C18.

The best way to test these sensors is using a constant current source. The sensors are designed to read 0-6A of current. To test the array sensor, route current from the GND plane through the array's - terminal. To test the battery sensor, route current from the battery's - terminal through the GND plane. Run the MPPT software and verify that it reads current.

If you don't have a constant current source, you can use a power resistor and a constant voltage source to simulate one. A 1ohm 50W resistor will translate 6V to 6A. You can either solder one lead onto the GND plane (one of the large capacitors is a good place to do this) or screw it into the connector for the sensor being tested. Use the voltage source to route current as you would with the constant current source.

Now may be a good time to calibrate these sensors as well.

3.2 Voltage Sensors, LEDs, and Test Points
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
NOTE: Due to a silkscreen mistake, the "zener" and "ordinary" labels are swapped on the Solar Array voltage sensor. Please note that D5 is a zener and D6 is a general purpose diode, not the other way around.

Start by installing the D5-8 and LED1-2. Be careful to install the diodes in the correct orientation - there are silkscreen labels indicating orientation. Then install the resistors R3-6 and R12-13. Finally, install test points 1, 2, 23, and 24.

To test these sensors, apply large voltages across Battery +/- and across Array +/-. The LED circuitry for the array is designed for up to 70V, while the LED circuitry for the battery is designed for 80-130V. Run the MPPT software and verify that it reads voltage.

Now may be a good time to calibrate these sensors as well.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. FET Driver
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Install the driver chip U3 first. Then check for the following shorts:
* Between Iso 9V + and PWM (PWM+ test point)
* Between Iso 9V + and the driver chip output (pins 6-7)
* Between PWM and GND (PWM- test point)
* Between the driver chip output and GND (Gate- test point)

Install the other surface mount components: R2, R7, C6, C8, D4, D9, and D10. Be careful to install the diodes in the correct orientation - there are silkscreen labels indicating orientation. Finally, install test points 11, 12, 27, and 28 and then the large capacitor C7.

Plug in the Nucleo and 12V Car Power and run different PWM signals through the FET driver. Measure both the input signal (PWM+/-) and the output signal (Gate+/-) and verify that they are aligned (within reason) and have the correct duty cycle and voltage levels (3.3V for input, 9V or 12V for output depending on isolating regulator).

5. CAN
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Install the CAN Transceiver U5. Check for the following shorts:
* Between Nucleo 5V and GND
* Between Nucleo 3.3V and GND
* Between Nucleo 3.3V and RX
* Between CAN Iso Vout + and -
* Between CAN Iso Vin + and -
* Between CAN H and L
* Between CAN H and CAN ISO Vout-
You might also check for other faults between adjacent pins.

Install the small components nearest the transceiver: C9-16, L2-3, and R25. Double check for the following shorts:
* Between Nucleo 5V and 3.3V
* Between CAN Iso Vout+ and Vin+
* Across R25 (indicates a solder jump between R25 and C12 if
  R25 isn't 0R)

Install the remaining small components: R9-10, R21-22, LED8-9, and U7. Then install test points 13-16 and 19-22, JP1, and J4-5.

Plug in the Nucleo and connect J5 or J6 to a CAN bus and run a CAN communication test to ensure that the installed CAN circuitry is functional.

6. DC/DC Converter (power electronics)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Install the test points Snubber +/M/- (TP3, 4, and 25). Then install the Array and Battery connectors (J1 and J2), the fuse holder (F1), and the snubber resistor and capacitor (R1 and C3).

At this point, all that should be left to install are the high power capacitors (C1 and 2), the inductor coil (L1), the heat sinks, the MOSFETs (Q1 and 2), and the Schottky diodes (D1-3). You can install these in whichever order you think is most convenient, but my recommendation is as follows:
1. Install all three heat sinks.
2. Install the MOSFETs and Schottky diodes.
3. Connect the MOSFETs and Schottky diodes to their
   respective heatsinks.
4. Install the high power capacitors.
5. Install the inductor coil.

You should now have a completed MPPT to test as a whole.
