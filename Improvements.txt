Future Improvements
============================================================
This is a list of changes we can make to the board in future versions to improve it in various ways. Some of these are functional, others are purely aesthetic.

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Correct Errata
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There are several mistakes in the current revision of the board (schematic rev 3.1, pcb rev 1.2), some of which are more important than others. These should be corrected in the next version of the board before making any other improvements.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Isolate Nucleo From High-Power Domain

Currently, the Nucleo operates in the same power domain (that is, the same ground and without isolation) as the high power components of the board - that is, the DC/DC boost converter. It would be far safer for it to be isolated, both for the Nucleo itself and for users interacting with it.

Once the Nucleo is properly isolated from the high-power domain, it can either be tied directly to the car's low-power domain, or it can remain isolated from it. For simplicity I recommend tieing it to the car's low-power domain, but it might be slightly safer for operators if it's isolated.

Three major components would need to be reworked to enable this:
1. the voltage sensors
2. the current sensors
3. the MOSFET driver

2.1. Upgrading the voltage sensors

To upgrade the voltage sensors, we would want to use an isolating amplifier such as the AMC1211. This chip has an input range of 0-2V, so we would need to adjust the voltage dividers and their protection diodes appropriately. Both the input and the output require 3.3-5V power.

The output of TI's isolating amplifiers, unfortunately, is differential rather than single-sided. (Explain how to convert this. example in datasheet. Idea: difference amplifier like INA132?)

2.2. Upgrading the current sensors

TODO (just like voltage sensors, but with current-sense isolating amplifiers)

2.3. Upgrading the MOSFET driver

This is a fairly easy upgrade, since our current chip already looks a lot like an isolated FET driver.

TI designs chips specifically for driving MOSFETs through isolation. One example of this is the UCC21541, with dual-channel isolation.* On the input/Nucleo side, you would provide 3.3V power from the Nucleo and use standard IO to drive IN_A. On the output side, you would provide 12V from the high-power domain and route the output just like you would from our current chip.

As of this writing, the price for the UCC21541 is similar to that of our current chip, but Mouser currently doesn't stock it. We would want to find one that operates similarly but that Mouser actually stocks.

* We only need one channel, but the only chips TI offers with one-channel isolation are far more complicated to use.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Make Battery/Array Connectors Vertical, Not Right-Angle
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is a fairly simple improvement, but it would allow for further compaction of the board by letting us, for example, place low-power systems on the other side of the power connectors. It also standardizes the orientation of all of the connectors on the board - the car power and CAN connectors are already vertical.

The appropriate part numbers for this would be 1720916 (3-pin) and 1720903 (2-pin).

------------------------------------------------------------
4. Improve Branding/Add Revision Marking
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The old Pholociraptor board had a big Longhorn on the bottom silkscreen. It would be fun to add that again, or maybe a UT SVT logo. Additionally, we should add a revision marking so that it's clear which version of the board we're looking at when holding a physical board.
